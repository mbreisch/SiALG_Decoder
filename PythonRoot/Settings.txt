####
#   This is a settings file for the overall framework. A sub-function will produce a global dictonary from them.
#   Therefore a structure like this is used Settings["Category"]["Value dictonary"]. Category is a string identifier.
#   To make new categories use "+" at the beginning of the line. For entries in the categories a "key = value" cobination is used values can be either int, float, list or string.
#   The value dictonary will then have an entry with under the key as string and the value as it's intended type.
#   '#' is used as comment, empty lines will be skipped.
#   The gobal dictonary can be used across all modules as long as the "DataCloud" module is imported
